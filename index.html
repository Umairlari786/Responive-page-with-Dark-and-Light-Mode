            </h2>
            <p>
                Punctuation is a procedure wherein symbols or signs are presented to a reader to indicate the manner in 
                which a sentence has been constructed and how it is supposed to be read. Written accounts are constructed 
                based on the robust foundation of sentences. These are complete statements. Punctuation within a sentence
                 not only provides the manner in which it should be read but it also brings in clarity in the meaning.
                  It is mandatory that each sentence begins with a capital letter and ends in a full-stop, question mark or exclamation mark. 
                  This simple system would indicate that a given sentence is complete.
